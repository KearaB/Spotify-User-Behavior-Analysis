### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Spotify user behavior to uncover insights into user demographics, listening habits, engagement patterns, and the influence of music on mood. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset obtained from Kaggle, the analysis explores various aspects of user interaction with the Spotify platform, including subscription preferences, music discovery methods, and the impact of different moods on music choice.


### Features
* User Demographics Analysis: Explore age, gender, and subscription plan distributions.
* Listening Habits: Investigate preferred genres, podcasts, and times for music listening.
* Engagement Analysis: Assess user engagement levels based on listening frequency and subscription details.
* Mood Influence: Analyze how different moods influence music and podcast listening preferences.


### Prerequisites
Before running the spotify_analysis.ipynb notebook, ensure you have the following:

* Python 3: The analysis is conducted using Python, with a version >= 3.6 recommended.
* Jupyter Notebook: For interacting with the .ipynb file format.
* Required Libraries: Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
    * pandas
    * numpy
    * matplotlib
    * seaborn
    * uuid

You can install these libraries using pip:

`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn uuid`
